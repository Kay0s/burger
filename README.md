## Description

To dynamically and quickly create and delete burger data, Express, MySQL, Heroku and Handlebars were utilized to:

- Serve and display a working data base of burgers available to eat, those that have been devoured and the ability to
  delete burgers.

## Installation

1. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules and .DS store. This ensures that the node_modules directory isn't
   tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
2. Use the command-line, npm i, to install Express, Express-Handlebars, and mysql npm.
3. To start creating, devouring, and deleting burgers using Express, use the command, node server.js and navigate in the
   web browser to localhost:8080.

## Usage

- Express and Heroku and used to serve and display to the the user Handlebars HTML templated info of their created and
  devoured burgers.
- Handlebars is used to render the HTML.
- Once the user's information regarding:
  - created burger is inputed into the input box:
- An Handlebars HTML file with the user's added burger and unique id is created.
- User's burgers can be deleted based on the id in the MySQL database and the delete routes.

## Test

Test the different HTML pages/positions on the local host using Express, to ensure that the data is saving and the MySQL
database is accessed.
